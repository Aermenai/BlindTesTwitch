## Description

The streamer logs in to their Spotify account from the application, configures the name of their Twitch channel and the device on which to play the music, then selects one of their playlists.

Once everything is setup, the application displays the blind-test view that the streamer can capture/stream, along with its Spotify sound. It displays the leaderboard, and the current song's items to guess.

The viewers type their guesses in the chat when a song plays, and the app will read chat messages to determine who found the correct answer(s) first, and reward them with points.

## TODO
- Fancy CSS animations
- Dark/Light mode
- Edit view to change/add inputs to guess
